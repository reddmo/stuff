So I started [a new blog](https://bike.stuffandthings.lol) to track my bike commuting. It's a focused blog specific to that purpose and things related to it (apps, accessories, etc.). It was built based on [11ty Base Blog v9](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/tree/v9), which requires [11ty 3.0.0-beta](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.1).

This blog will remain. It will be focused on tech, politics, finance/fiscal affairs, and the economy (plus related topics). I realize that's still a range of topics but they relate. I'll also continue posts about tracking my progress building this and *bikes&things*. 

I hope whoever reads this keeps enjoying it and check out the other one if you like biking (feel free to [follow me on Mastodon](https://social.lol/@jasonm) and provide some feedback on either).
